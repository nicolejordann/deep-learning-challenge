# deep-learning-challenge
Write an analysis that includes a title and multiple sections, labeled with headers and subheaders (4 points)

Format images in the report so that they display correction (2)

Explain the purpose of the analysis (4)

Answer all 6 questions in the results section (10)

Summarize the overall results of your model (4)

Describe how you could use a different model to solve the same problem, and explain why you would use that model (6)





Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
IS_SUCCESSFUL Column.


What variable(s) are the features for your model?
AFFILIATION, APPLICATION_TYPE, ASK_AMT, CLASSIFICATION, INCOME_AMT, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS.


What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
NAME and EIN are not needing in this model.


Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
